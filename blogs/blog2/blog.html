            My expose to Ruskin Bond was in middle school in class 6. There was a story the name of which I forgot. It was about a muddy rainwater puddle at the back of his house in Dehradun, there was a boy named Ramu and there was Grandpa and Bond himself as a child. This was my first Ruskin Bond story. Since then, I have formed a romantic ‘Bond’ with all his writings. I have spent many idle, languid sunny afternoons on our roof under the shade of those betel nut and jack fruit trees that dot in my uncle’s compound, half lying on the charpoy and reading Ruskin Bond; his memoirs or Rusty, that Anglo-Indian boy who has so much more adventures in life than I ever had.

            His love stories and memoirs on the other hand had a feeling of departure, the separation of two people or the departure of a time gone by but still something remained; feeling and expectations. The Night Train at Deoli is one such story where curiosity brings him together with his long-lost lover and the hotel is like the utopia that we all dream about where all our wish is fulfilled, at least for sometimes but not for entirety. At last, like it or not you have to leave that hotel there is no staying there forever, much like our daydreams. That’s what makes Ruskin Bond special to me; his out of the ordinary stories go full vigour against traditional norms. There is no end, no achievement, no destination just the journey and the experience and the lingering feeling afterwards.

            His stories about small towns of North India are in no way less charming than his love stories. He makes even the most mundane of places interesting, like the bus stop Pipalnagar. I don’t know how he poured in so much romanticism in to that bare dusty bus stop. But somehow he has managed to attract me to that place for years. A lone bus stop in some forgotten village of Northern India. Delhi is not far is another example of small-town romanticism; these small bare dusty towns of north India owes a lot to Ruskin Bond for gifting them this picture of hope and aspiration, for making them romantic. Which of course is amazing and at the same time ironic given the present situation of North India. In the story ‘Who killed the Rani’ we see an inefficient fat police officer visiting him, drinking bear and chilling almost every evening, and where? Of course in some hot and humid North Indian city. Oh, what an experience it would be to sit on the roof of a house in North India on an easy chair looking at the bright red setting sun go down the horizon while a gentle breeze cools you down while you sip a bottle of bear.

            Of travel, the stories are many, some on the mountains, some on railway tracks, some on fields and roads. The only thing common in all these travel is the discovery, it’s either an old forgotten unused well where pigeons have taken their abode, or a pool surrounded by jungle on all side, or if nothing else a flower crawling out of a stony wall; the joy lies in the find. One of his story delves with the description an alternate path that he had to take while returning from Delhi to Mussoorie. The description of the path and the villages that dot by it is something that speaks of his inner comfort with the world, because mind you those journeys, especially the ones through an alternate route was and still is ‘not-comfortable’ to say the least.

            His ghost stories too are a little different. It is not always the horror or the event that matters but it deals with ghostly feelings. Like the whistling boy with all his haunting mischiefs and his nightly errands still cares for the author when he falls sick; the boy returns each night whistling below his window while he is bed ridden. Gulabi the wife of General Young also speaks the same language- emotion, the emotion that led her to suicide and how it is similar to the present couples he was staying with. That is the essence of his ghostly stories. But not all stories mind you! Some are scary as well like the Bhoot aunty; that young women in white sari who stands by the roads to Mussoorie and asks for a lift from all passing cars. Then who can forget the face in the dark, I don’t know why I sense a little humour in that story. No doubt it is scary but still.

            Even the ghost stories edited by him are great- ‘Ghost Stories from the Raj’ in particular is a fascinating read. It has some bizarre ghosts that were very much common in India during the British Raj but we don’t hear about them anymore. There are a range of stories about Jins, Mujnias- the ghost of young Brahmin boy who died before his marriage, Tiger-people who could change from man to tiger and vice-versa, and spirits of former village landowners who would not allow anyone to cultivate or occupy their land. These stories were mostly written by wanderers as in the case of the stories narrated by John Campbell who was a gun founder to the court of Mughal emperor Jahangir or Colonels and Civil Servants who were serving in India at that time like Col. W.H. Sleeman and C.A Kincaid, or by housewives like Alice Perrin whose stories were quite popular in England at that time. Even Kipling the poet of the Empire had occasionally dealt with ghost stories like ‘The return of Imray’.

            So, there is little in the writing world that Ruskin Bond hasn’t touched. From love to ghosts, from Novels to Poems he has done it all, now even social media. He is in Instagram if you didn’t know! But all this did not happen in a day it took quite some time or to be truthful a very long time indeed. But he remained patient and succeeded to amaze, sooth and entertain an entire generation of a country and any more to come.
