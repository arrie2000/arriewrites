            Have you seen the movie ‘Titli’ by Rituparno Ghosh? If you haven’t then I would recommend you to watch it. And you would ask, why? And I will reply that it’s beautiful. And let me also tell you this that I am not a reviewer I am not reviewing this movie but simply sharing my feelings and yes there will be spoilers ahead so I would recommend you to watch the movie first.

            So, one morning on a trip to some place you meet your favourite idol on the way. Suppose his car has broken down and he asks for a lift. First you are awe struck next you try to put on some conversation but then even your car breaks down but the actor is not in a hurry, rather he is better poised to continue his conversation. What will you do next? That is the situation Titli finds herself in. The Superstar that she adored so much that she even wants to marry him has suddenly turned up at her car door asking for a lift. She of course could not bear it much longer. The only one who she has devoted her life to, collecting his pictures reading about him all these days and now suddenly bam! He is here in front of her standing with an empty cigarette packet in his hand. She decides to get some air she asks for the packet and runs off to buy a new pack, but she is in no hurry she needs some time to soak it all in, to make sense of all that is happening since morning. So, she decides to take the longer route through the winding foot paths of the hill, taking time to stand against a deodar tree and peek a view of the car standing far below in the mist. She inhales the fragrance of the pack, the very pack which was just a few moments before was in the blazer pockets of her love. She cannot decide if it’s reality or imagination the mist makes it even more dreamy, unreal.

            But here at the car there’s another story unravelling. Where Rohit Roy seems a little uncomfortable to be left alone with Titli’s mother. He seems hesitant and uncomfortable but at last he approaches the car door and asks her “Tumi boloni oke aamar bepare?” “You didn’t tell her about me?” and then adding “Kemon acho Urmi?”, and the audience goes kaboom! What was that? Did the superstar know Titli’s mom all this while and even she knew him and never told anybody? He did not give way his feelings even when he saw her and acted as a stranger all this while. This was a surprise, a very big one. The tone of the story changes from here now the tone is of reunion, of nostalgia, unfinished romance. But it is all sweet much like poem not wanting more just all talks about the days gone by. The mood is even more heightened by the fog and the mountain and the trees as if the elements were bent upon preserving their secret. Of those two old love birds that destiny separated not by just miles but by time as well. Here they were side by side all alone again but will time permit it or society? No, its silly even to think that but they can steal time, very little may be but it won’t hurt to re-live what they had lost, to reminiscent those old days.

            The one thing that love story stands out is the old school romanticism in them. She narrates him a poem, sings her a song- a Rabindra Sangeet all while having a pleasant conversation. This is not the norm of contemporary love, as Titli finds out later her friend does not narrate poems to her lover. Even old school economic and class disparity is visible perhaps even stressed upon in flashbacks. The dingy small house of Rohit Roy in the colony before his career took off is really a contrast to the wide decorated and well-furnished house of Urmi on her wedding day. Which I think is the norm not only of old romantic Hindi cinemas but also of reality. It goes on without saying that there was no match between them, but still they fell in love. It seems that even then they were doing the same thing that they were doing now after all these twenty-two years, stealing a moment.

            But what will happen when Titli knows about their secret? The superstar is her heartthrob, the one she has been dreaming all her life and now when she suddenly discovers that not only he knows her mom but is also her ex-lover, what will be her reaction then? That’s when the story gets complicated because she eventually finds out unaware of her mother or the superstar. She had bought a picture postcard of Kanchenjunga at sunrise because the actor had mentioned that the mountain was hidden by clouds during his stay. But her mood has changed she is sad now and a little contemptuous of her mother; she quietly hands over the postcard to Rohit Roy. She thinks that her mother is cheating on her father by not telling him the truth about Rohit Roy. She is even more heart broken of the fact that he is not some distant star anymore but is a close relative now. So much so that she cannot think about marrying her anymore and that’s what breaks her heart. She weeps tries to subdue her feelings but to no avail. She talks to her mother when she is found out crying in her bedroom pressing her face in the pillow. However, she eventually gets over it and even feels for her mother when news comes that Rohit Roy has married. Yes, Rohit did not marry until then. Even he reconciled to his past after that meeting.
