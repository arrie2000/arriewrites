        <h2 class="postHeading">Deshe Bideshe(In A Land Far From Home)- a review</h2>
        <h6>By: Arijeet Debnath</h6>

        <p class="postPara">
            Deshe Bideshe by Sayeed Mujtaba Ali is undoubtedly the most humorous book in Bengali literature and not just humour, it even gets serious, philosophical, reflective and outright poetical and political- a all in one package I would say. There is even an excellent translation in English named- â€˜In a land Far From Homeâ€™. This book is a travelogue or a travel story (at least on paper) of the authorâ€™s journey to Afghanistan from India through Khyber Pass and his stay in Kabul for a year and a half. He had taken up a job as a teacher in one of the new government schools in Kabul constructed by the then very reformist ruler of Afghanistan king Aman-Ulla.

        <p class="postPara">
            Let me first give you a back story as to why he had gone to Kabul in the first place. See, the author Sayeed Mujtaba Ali was a nationalist and somehow, he got into a tussle with the British government in India and he had vowed that he would never study in any institute under the British Raj. So, after schooling he went to Vishwa Bharati university which at that time was Shanti Niketan and had studied there for some time, and in the 1920â€™s Shanti Niketan was still not a registered university under the government of India. The only important signatory of Shantiniketan at that time was the Poet Rabindranath Tagore. After finishing his studies in Shantiniketan he made up his mind to go to Germany to pursue his higher studies. But where to get the fund? So, then he decided to take up a job in Kabul to earn and save up enough to able to study in Germany. He made his visit to Kabul in the year 1927 and remained there till almost 1929.

        <p class="postPara">
            See, even at that time Afghanistan was a very interesting place and even at that time the great game was being played by the Soviet Empire in the north and the British Empire at the South of Kabul. Afghanistan at that time was and independent kingdom ruled by king Aman-Ulla who had previously ousted all British influence from his kingdom and hence it sorts of acted as a buffer zone between those two great powers. Since, Afghanistan was strategically important in the contemporary geopolitics many developed countries especially of Europe had set up their embassies in Kabul. Hence, we find many Europeans in the book.

        <p class="postPara">
            So, lets come back to the book. The book is divided into roughly three parts. First Aliâ€™s travel from India to Afghanistan through the perilous steeps of Khyber Pass, second- his stay in Afghanistan for one and a half year and third- his escape from Afghanistan following the civil war that broke out. Luckily Ali was awarded a scholarship by the German high commissioner in Kabul so he had no problem studying in Germany later. The war was fought between the Afghan king Aman Ulla and a decoy leader Baccha-Sakao, much like the power struggle between todayâ€™s Afghan government and Taliban.

        <p class="postPara">
            Another interesting fact is that the book was actually written in mid-1940â€™s almost after 15 years of his travel. The Book is written in a conversational style of writing, the one we Bengaliâ€™s call â€˜Kotha Sahityaâ€™ and Ali has such charm in his writing that you almost feel like he is gossiping while sitting right in front of you. If I have to give a vague comparison of his writing style to any English novel then I would say that it is very close to Jerome K Jeromeâ€™s â€˜Three Men in a Boatâ€™. And like Jerome, Ali is known for his cunning sense of humour which he serves most deliciously by bringing up the most mundane everyday activities like some conversation British officials or simply his observation of some clouds going up a mountain slope (you should really read that story) with a strange mix of poetic expression and exquisite humour. He also reflects on the beauty of Kabul, itâ€™s rich history and culture and contrasts it with the stark reality on ground- the Poverty and Lawlessness. 
        </p>
        <p class="postPara">
            The story is gripping the moment you pick it up and it maintains the pace throughout. You not only get to know about one of our most important neighbours in the subcontinent but also come across a wide variety of culture. From mountain dwelling Afghans to sea faring British to Iranians, Afghans, Kabulis, French, among Russians the Tsarists and the Bolsheviks. Then there is history both contemporary and pre-medieval. The other thing that might surprise you is that how much todayâ€™s Afghanistan is similar to the Afghanistan a hundred years back. The same geopolitics, the same security issues the same plight with just new names and characters.

        <p class="postPara">
            But if you are reading the original Bengali version and you are new to reading or if you are new to Bengali language then I would suggest you to take time before reading this book. As I have been told by one of my novice friends that he found the book a little hard to read. Itâ€™s because there are some hard words and some sentences might be too overwhelming for some readers but if you are confident on your grip on the language then you can easily take it up. For those who canâ€™t read Bengali they can take up the translated version- â€˜In a Land Far From Homeâ€™, which I have been told is equally great and keeps alive the essence of the original text. 
        </p>
        <p class="postPara">
            So, read this book at the first chance you get and I can promise that you will be musing over it for several days ðŸ˜Š
